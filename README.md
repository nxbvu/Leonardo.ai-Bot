# Leonardo.ai Automation Bot

An automation script for Leonardo.ai that can create accounts and scrape generated pictures, ideal for bulk creation.

## Instructions

3. **Organize Files:**

4. **Set Download Path:**
   - Open `pictures.py` and set your desired download path.

5. **Create Accounts:**

   - Adjust values like `quit` and `thread_count` to suit your preferences.

6. **Account Storage:**
   - `Login.txt` will store all newly created accounts.
   - `tr.txt` will contain all used accounts.

## Notes

- **Errors:** You may encounter errors if Leonardo.ai changes class names or other elements on their site.
- **Disclaimer:** I have a guilty conscience and do not use this script. It's better to purchase the premium service for unlimited use.
